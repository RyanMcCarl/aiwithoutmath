# About

We propose developing materials to communicate fundamental AI and ML concepts to an educated but nontechnical audience.

If we want nontechnical stakeholders to respond to AI developments in an informed way, we must help them acquire an understanding of AI and ML.

Explanations involving advanced math will not reach many people who need to make informed decisions about AI.

This website is a work in progress. If you can contribute in any way (writing/reviewing/editing content, funding, design and development, etc.), please contact Ryan McCarl
