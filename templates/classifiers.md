# Classifiers

A classifier is a program that categorizes items as one type of thing or another. For example, a picture might be classified as a “cat picture” or a “dog picture.” If you feed (input) an image into a classifier designed to distinguish cat pictures from dog pictures, it would calculate the probability that the image shows a cat against the probability that it shows a dog.
