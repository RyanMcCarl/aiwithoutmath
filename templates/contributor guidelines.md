# Contributor guidelines

[AI Without Math](http://www.aiwithoutmath.com) needs and welcomes contributions of any kind. To be a valuable resource, the site needs to add (and carefully review) articles and resources covering most of the important topics and algorithms in AI and machine learning. Contributing to the site is a great way to practice explaining AI concepts, create a portfolio of writing about AI and ML, and be part of a project that will make in-depth knowledge about AI accessible to a broad audience.

Here are some guidelines for contributors. Please carefully review them all before submitting.

# General guidelines

- The best way to contribute writing or editing is to make a pull request to our [Github repository](https://github.com/RyanMcCarl/aiwithoutmath) are preferred. If you don't know how to make pull requests, please submit your article or edits as markdown files attached to an [issue](https://github.com/RyanMcCarl/aiwithoutmath/issues) on the Github page.

# Development guidelines

- Our site is currently in the prototype stage; as such, it is visually unattractive. The editor is not a professional web developer. We encourage designers and developers with expertise in Bootstrap 4, Sass, and CSS to submit pull requests or make UI/UX suggestions.
- Developers with expertise in Python and Flask can also submit pull requests to improve our code.
- If a developer submits a site improvement that we use, we can credit the developer on the "About" page of the website.

# Writing guidelines

- Please review other articles on [aiwithoutmath.com](aiwithoutmath.com) to get a sense of the tone, style, and level of  technicality we are looking for. We want each article on our site to meet the following criteria:

(1) *Clarity*: Articles must be comprehensible to college-educated people without a background in mathematics or computer science. Use plain language whenever possible. All jargon or technical vocabulary must be defined and explained.
(2) *Depth*: Avoid superficial overviews. Try to explain how concepts and algorithms actually work.
(3) *Examples*: Try to include explanatory analogies of each concept as well as examples of how each technique you describe can be used.
(4) *Concision*: Articles should be as short as possible.
(5) *Modularity*: Articles should be self-contained and not require reference to other articles (but optional links to other articles and outside resourecs are welcome).

- **Math**. Although the title of the website promises "no math," articles can use arithmetic, high school algebra, coordinate planes, and basic matrices if absolutely necessary to convey a concept. We prefer plain-language explanations whenever possible.
- **Markdown**. We draft our articles in plain text files using the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax, which is easy to learn and use. If you make a  submit an article, please draft it in a plain text editor (such as [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)) and name it something like "neural networks.md" (using all lowercase characters and the ".md" extension).
- **Images**. We encourage you to use images in your article. If you use images, however, you must ensure they are in the public domain (or licensed for all uses, commercial and noncommercial), provide image credits, and link to the source where you found the image.
- **Multimedia resources**. In addition to written articles, we encourage multimedia submissions such as demonstrations and videos. Ideally, please host these on an external site and submit them as links within a markdown file. If you want us to host the resource, create an issue in the GitHub repository describing the resource and what you need.
- **Proofreading**. Thoroughly proofread and revise your work before submitting. Consider running your text through a grammar and style checker such as [Grammarly](grammarly.com), [ProWritingAid](https://prowritingaid.com), or [Proselint](https://github.com/amperser/proselint/) before submitting.
- **Credit**. If you would like credit for an article you submit, please add the following text at the bottom of the article:

```
*Author credits*:
- [Your name]
```

Note that if other authors or reviewers write about the same topic or make significant additions to your article, they may be credited as authors as well.

# Editing guidelines

- We welcome aggressive editing for accuracy, concision, and style. We hope to have at least two technical reviewers and two non-technical reviewers for each article.
- If you want to write a completely different explanation for a concept, that is fine too. We may choose to post both explanations or to blend the two explanations.

# Legal and practical notes

- **Editor's discretion**. All contributions may or may not be posted to the site in the discretion of the site's editor, who will consult as needed with reviewers. If posted, contributions may be heavily edited for accuracy, concision, style, and consistency with the site's aims.
- **Ownership of content**. The website owners will acquire shared ownership of all content posted to the site and may use or reproduce it. If we do use or reproduce an article, we will credit the article's authors. Contributors retain co-ownership of all text they contribute. This means that if you submit an article to us, you can use the portion that you contributed on other sites or in other publications.
