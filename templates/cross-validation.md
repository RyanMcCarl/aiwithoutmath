# Cross Validation

If you are trying to learn what is the best amount of salt to add to your food, you would probably need to try adding different amounts and train yourself on the best possible amount to add, and then you would test your decision on the food you offer to your friends and get their feedback. For each amount you then  also try on your friends first and then test on yourself and see if you will find a better amount.

Trying to find the best value while training on some people, then testing on different people is called Cross Validation, because we are simply trying to validate and check the value by crossing over different groups of people.
