# Expert systems

Think about the way a doctor knows what is wrong with a patient: he starts asking questions and  based on the answers he deduces what is most probably the problem.

If you say yes, he would think it could be due to elevated blood pressure, and continue asking you about other relevant symptoms, if you say no, he will ask you is it in your forehead? And so on until he has a probable diagnosis.
